# Caretake
Mobile application platform for cancer patients to record and report various measurements. 

Cancer patients endure debilitating side effects during chemotherapy which undermines many basic tasks that people can perform normally. Some patients are not fortunate enough to have a caregiver at all times that can provide aide to the patients such as managing symptoms, diet, and excersise. The Caretake mobile application will substutite many of the duties a caregiver would perform. Our app will manage the following:

#### 1. Pain 

#### 2. Symptom 

#### 3. Nasuea 

#### 4. Diet

#### 5. Excercise 

#### 6. Bowel Movement

#### 7. Fatigue

#### 8. Medication

With the information in one source, patients can generate a more accurate report for their oncologists at their vists.
